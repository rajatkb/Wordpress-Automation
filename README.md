# Wordpress-Automation
I have a personnel blog where i post question for my friends in order to help them. Also i started with uploading Porject Euler solution. So in order to have to manage folders all of these i wanted to automate my system. Hence this python script

it  uses most of the inbuilt modules
the external dependencies are

1. requests : for getting the html web page

*for now whenever i run the script it updates the folder based on what questions i have upadated on the site.
its a work in progress 

future goals :
*add google drive integration for syncing the work folder over multiple machines i have
*also have the script interact with wordpress for allowing it to upload the solution directly if possible.
